This package provides common operations for dealing with biological sequence
data. The package is not exhaustive and sometimes only provides representations
for essential data without operations. (For example, a representation of a
multiple-sequence alignment without a multiple-sequence alignment algorithm.)

The sequence type defined here is used throughout other Go packages in the
TuftsBCB group.

Documentation for this package can be found here:
